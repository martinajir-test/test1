# Thread Testing

## Purpose
This file is used for testing thread functionality in the application.

## Test Case: Trigger and Leave
- **Action**: Trigger a request
- **Expected Behavior**: Thread should handle the scenario where the initiator leaves the channel
- **Status**: Testing in progress

## Messages
1. Initial request triggered
2. Thread created successfully
3. User left the channel
4. Thread should persist and remain accessible

## Notes
This is a test scenario to verify that threads remain functional even when the original requester leaves the channel.
