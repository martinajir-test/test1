# Quick Ask

Have a quick question? Here's how to get help fast!

## How to Use Quick Ask

1. **Check existing issues** - Your question might already be answered
2. **Keep it brief** - Quick asks should be concise and to the point
3. **Provide context** - Include relevant details to help us understand your question
4. **Tag appropriately** - Use the `quick-ask` label when creating an issue

## What Makes a Good Quick Ask?

✅ **Good Examples:**
- "How do I configure X feature?"
- "What's the recommended way to handle Y?"
- "Where can I find documentation for Z?"

❌ **Not Quick Asks:**
- Complex feature requests
- Bug reports (use the bug template instead)
- Questions requiring extensive debugging
